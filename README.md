A content-based movie recommendation app built with Python and Streamlit that enables users to receive the top 30 similar movies by entering a movie name. Recommendations are generated using NLP techniques (TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity). Users can also download results in Excel format.

Project Description
This system uses metadata (genres, keywords, cast, director, and overview) to find similar movies. The similarity is computed using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity, allowing efficient and accurate recommendations based on content.

Core Idea
Input: A movie name from the dataset

Process: Text vectorization + similarity score calculation

Output: A list of top 30 similar movies with Excel export functionality

Tech Stack
Frontend: Streamlit (Python-based UI)

Backend Logic: Python, Pandas, NLTK, Scikit-learn

File Generation: Pandas + XlsxWriter

Data Storage: Pickled .pkl files (preprocessed)

Dataset Overview
Contains 4803 movies

Each movie has 24 features, including title, cast, crew, genres, overview, etc.

Cleaned and processed to retain relevant fields for content-based filtering

Features
Movie Selection Dropdown: Select a movie from a preloaded list

Top 30 Similar Movies: Based on cosine similarity of metadata

On-Screen Display: Ranked list of recommended movies

Excel File Export: Download recommendations with a custom filename

Fuzzy Matching: Uses difflib.get_close_matches() for typo-tolerant movie name input

Steps Performed
Step 1: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Dropped irrelevant columns: homepage, tagline, revenue, etc.

Removed missing values

Extracted year from release_date

Standardized numeric features

Step 2: Feature Engineering
Combined: genres, keywords, cast, director, overview

Created a new column tags for unified textual data

Step 3: Text Normalization
Used NLTK's PorterStemmer

Removed stopwords

Cleaned tokens

Step 4: TF-IDF Vectorization
Converted tags into 5000-length vectors using TfidfVectorizer

Step 5: Cosine Similarity Calculation
Applied cosine similarity on TF-IDF vectors

Created a similarity matrix for all movie pairs

Step 6: Matching & Recommendation
Used fuzzy matching to resolve user input

Retrieved similarity scores

Sorted and returned top 30 results (excluding the selected movie)

Step 7: Export & Optimization
Pickled the cleaned DataFrame and similarity matrix

Loaded preprocessed data during app runtime for faster response

Created Excel in-memory using BytesIO()

Enabled download using Streamlit's download_button()

Limitations
Limited to the dataset (no new or real-time movie info)

Fuzzy matching is basic â€“ may fail for complex typos

No explicit error handling for unmatched titles

Future improvements: real-time APIs, better user input validation, error messages
